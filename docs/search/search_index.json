Projects in our lab are rarely repetitive. You should be willing to get outside your comfort zone on a regular basis and embrace a steep learning curve. It is normal to struggle and be frustrated when you are learning something new, so you should not feel discouraged. Most ideas and experiments are not correct the first time, and need to be iteratively refined. Your project's success depends on how well you are able to learn from failures.</p> </li> <li> <p>develops the ability to formulate and solve problems on their own. Irrespective of your career stage and career goals, we aim to train independently thinking scientific leaders, and not merely skilled research technicians. In practice, this means you should spend your first year in the lab learning skills and concepts from others. After that, your focus should shift towards learning to solve problems on your own. After a few years in the lab, you should be able to formulate questions, design strategies to answer them, and mentor junior lab members.</p> </li> <li> <p>is organized in performing experiments, analyzing data, and recording work.  Results of our work are often unpredictable, so it is important to follow a systematic approach for performing and recording our work so that you can rigorously interpret your results. Following lab-wide conventions will help others and the future-you to think critically about your results without struggling to understand your old workflows.</p> </li> <li> <p>is collaborative and collegial. All new projects in the lab build off the discoveries and expertise of previous lab members. When you join our lab, you will work closely and learn from others in the lab. When you have spent a few years in the lab, you will help others get started with new techniques even if you do not directly benefit from them.</p> </li> <li> <p>is respectful. All of us share a common passion for scientific research, but we often come from different cultural backgrounds, have distinct strengths and weaknesses, personalities, and working styles.

If you use a specification of the form <code>singularity: \"docker://ghcr.io/rasilab/r:1.0.0\"</code> within a Snakemake rule, then this Docker container will be pulled to your local directory, converted to a Singularity container, and stored at <code>.snakemake/singularity</code> in your current working directory.  However, it takes a long time to download and convert each Docker container and each container also uses up several GB of space.  To avoid this, Rasi has stored a copy of all commonly used Singularity containers in our lab at <code>/fh/working/subramaniam_a/singularity</code>. You can symbolically link this folder to your workflow by executing the following from the folder that contains your Snakemake file:</p> <pre><code>mkdir .snakemake\ncd .snakemake\nln -s /fh/working/subramaniam_a/singularity .\n</code></pre> <p>This will make all common singularity containers (files ending with <code>.simg</code>) immediately available to your Snakemake workflow.
